OpenWeatherMapAPI.py code 
This code uses the requests library to make HTTP requests to the OpenWeatherMap API. It retrieves the current weather information and forecasts for the specified location and displays the results.

Make sure to have the requests library installed (pip install requests) before running this code.

Theam 2 - Simple E-commerce Inventory Management System (Java)
-------------------------------------------------------------

This code defines a class InventoryManagementSystem that uses a HashMap to store the inventory. It provides methods to add products to the inventory, update product quantities, and view the current inventory.

In the main method, a Scanner is used to accept user input and display a menu with options to add products, update quantities, view the inventory, or exit the program.

You can run this code in any Java IDE or by executing java InventoryManagementSystem in the command line.

Note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would typically use a database or file storage for persistent data and implement more robust error handling and validation.

In this code, the PersonalFinanceTracker class is defined, which maintains an array of transactions. The addTransaction method is used to add a new transaction to the tracker, specifying a description and the amount.

The getIncome, getExpenses, and getAccountBalance methods calculate the total income, total expenses, and the account balance, respectively, by iterating through the transactions array and summing the amounts based on their sign.

The getTransactionHistory method displays a history of all transactions recorded in the tracker.

The example usage demonstrates how to create a new instance of PersonalFinanceTracker, add transactions, and retrieve the income, expenses, account balance, and transaction history.

You can run this code in any JavaScript environment, such as a browser console or Node.js.

Theam 4
------------------------------------------------------------------
In this code, there are two classes defined: Task and TaskManager. The Task class represents a task with a description and a completion status. The TaskManager class manages the tasks by providing methods to add tasks, mark tasks as completed, and display the task list.

In the Main method, an instance of TaskManager is created, and a menu is displayed for the user to interact with the task management application. The user can choose to add a new task, mark a task as completed by specifying the task index, display the task list, or exit the application.

You can run this code in any .NET environment, such as Visual Studio or the .NET Core command-line interface (dotnet CLI).

In this code, the UrlShortener class is defined, which uses two hashes (short_to_long and long_to_short) to store the mappings between short URLs and their corresponding long URLs. The shorten method takes a long URL as input, checks if it has already been shortened, and returns the existing short URL if available. Otherwise, it generates a new short URL, stores the mappings, and returns the generated short URL. The redirect method takes a short URL as input and returns the corresponding long URL for redirection.

The example usage demonstrates how to create a new instance of UrlShortener, shorten a long URL, and redirect the shortened URL back to the original URL.

You can run this code in any Ruby environment or by executing ruby url_shortener.rb in the command line.
